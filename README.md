### "Dominik, you have a unique and rare name."

I've heard that sentence once too often from those responsible for the name and became slightly sceptical. I got the data from [Statistik Austria](https://www.statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/menschen_und_gesellschaft/bevoelkerung/geborene/vornamen/index.html) and wanted to see if there's something to it.
